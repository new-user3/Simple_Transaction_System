- Exit the transaction system using the `exit` command.

## How to Use

1. Compile the `backend.c` file to create the server executable.
2. Run the server executable.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the transaction system.
4. Use the CLI interface to send money, view help, or exit the system.
